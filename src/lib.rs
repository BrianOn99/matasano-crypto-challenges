// Efficiency is important here because most challanges need to run the function 10000 times
// Previously I made a fancy version which create a HashMap and lookup every u8, challenge 4 took
// 30 secs to run in unoptimized build.  During debugging challenge6 it is very annoying.
// The std AsciiExt trait has some function do something similar by table lookup, but it is
