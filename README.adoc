= Matasano Crypto Challenge attempted in Rust

== Motivation

Tired of at work, with Java (android development, which sucks), Python (Well, it sucks less but not
elegant), ObjC\++(WTF) / $wift(Fuck you Apple).  I *really* need to try something fresh, otherwise
I would go crazy.

Crytology is interesting, and Rust looks nice.  Why not do some crypto with Rust?

== About

There are some attempts on Matasano Crypto with Rust in Github, but none has completed further than
set2 (there are 8 sets for now).  Most of them just finish set1.  So I would like to at least break
the record, doing it from scratch.  I may pull some crate though.

=== Structure

The core algorithm is placed inside module `matasano::setN` which is usually inside
`src/setN/mod.rs`.  If the challenge question looks like "do this and then xyz should come out", a
assertion test will be written.  If the question is "do this and find out xyz", then there will be
a binary target.

[WARNING]
====
Some approaches are not optimal.  In most case performace is not cared.  Algorithm may not be
robust.  I would try to make code readable (at least to me :-P).
====

[NOTE]
====
Developed in rustc 1.20.0-nightly.  With current pace of rust development 1.20 will become stable
shortly, but anyway I have not used any experimental feature, so it should be able to be built with
1.0 I think.

== Current Progress

Set1 challenge3

Will update irregularly.
